        <p class="card-text">The UK has now introduced E10 unleaded petrol. The fuel will help reduce CO2 emissions, but could cause problems for older cars.E10 petrol was introduced across the UK from September 2021. However, research by the RAC shows 24 percent of drivers remain unaware of the new fuel – and around 600,000 cars aren’t compatible with it. Here, we explain what E10 is, including its pros and cons.The difference between the old E5 and new E10 grades of petrol is quite simple. The numbers refer to the percentage of bioethanol in the fuel. E5 has five percent and E10 contains 10 percent.Petrol and diesel had already been renamed at the pumps, to E5 and B7, to inform motorists of their biofuel content.</p>

Pay attention, or the car could fail its MOT – or much worse.Dashboard warning lights are important.

        <p className="card-text">Many UK motorways use technology to monitor and manage the flow of traffic. We explain how to drive safely on a smart motorway.Smart motorways use technology to control the flow of traffic, reduce congestion and improve journey times.There are three types of smart motorway in the UK:Dynamic hard shoulder: where the hard shoulder is temporarily opened up to traffic.
All-lane running: where the full width of the road is usable with emergency refuge areas alongside.
Controlled motorway: with three or more lanes, a hard shoulder and variable speed limits.Not everyone is a fan of smart motorways, with some motorists arguing that the absence of a hard shoulder makes them more dangerous than conventional motorways.</p>
